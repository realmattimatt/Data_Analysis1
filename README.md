# Data_Analysis1
## Homework VBA-challenge readme file.

### On the first sheet there is a Macro button called "Reset form", to reset the form and delete the fields getting generated.
### There is also a button called "Get Ticker", which when pressed will run the Macro to get the data needed.  
### I included 2 versions of the code. One was a .VBS format that would not pull up on my GUI but does here in GitHub. The other is a .CLS file that also works here. 

#### Extra credit?
<p>Hopefully? If not I learned something new in addition. Humor me here. Made for a great conversation in a study group. In the alaphbetical_testing xlsx file, the dates were in 20200102 format. When I seen the example of what the final outcome should look like I seen the date column in 1/2/2020 format. </p>

<p>A study group member pointed out that the date format in the Multiple_year_stock_data.xlxs, was already in the 01/02/2020 format. I did find out how to format the code in the Macro to run this on all sheets even though I didn't have to. Was great to laugh at it while learning. </p>
